# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the foundational step in the design process, serving as a visual guide or blueprint for a website or application. It outlines the structure, content, and functionality on a page without focusing on visual aesthetics. It's crucial for planning the user experience and ensuring the final product meets user needs.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

-   **Layout Structure:** This defines the overall arrangement of elements on the page, such as headers, footers, and sidebars. It's the skeleton of the design.
-   **Navigation:** This element shows how users will move through the application. It includes menus, links, and buttons, mapping the user's journey.
-   **Content Placement:** This specifies where text, images, and other media will be located. It ensures that information is organized logically.
-   **Functionality:** This indicates how interactive components will behave, such as buttons, search bars, and forms. It defines what the user can do on each screen.

## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are basic and simple, often sketched with pen and paper or simple digital tools. They focus solely on the layout and functionality, without any details on colors, fonts, or images. They are used early in the design process for quick brainstorming and conceptualization.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and polished. They include specific text, images, and visual elements, closely resembling the final product. They are used later in the process to present a clearer vision to stakeholders and for more detailed user testing.
