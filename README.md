# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the foundational step in the design process, serving as a visual guide or blueprint for a website or application. It outlines the structure, content, and functionality on a page without focusing on visual aesthetics. It's crucial for planning the user experience and ensuring the final product meets user needs.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

-   **Layout Structure:** This defines the overall arrangement of elements on the page, such as headers, footers, and sidebars. It's the skeleton of the design.
-   **Navigation:** This element shows how users will move through the application. It includes menus, links, and buttons, mapping the user's journey.
-   **Content Placement:** This specifies where text, images, and other media will be located. It ensures that information is organized logically.
-   **Functionality:** This indicates how interactive components will behave, such as buttons, search bars, and forms. It defines what the user can do on each screen.
